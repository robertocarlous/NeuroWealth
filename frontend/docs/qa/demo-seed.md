# Demo seed — deterministic mock data

**Issue:** #420  
**Module:** `src/lib/seeded-rng.ts`  
**Env var:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED`

---

## Why this exists

Mock data generated with `Math.random()` changes on every run, making visual
baseline screenshots and demo recordings flaky. Setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED`
activates a deterministic PRNG (Mulberry32) so every chart value, allocation
amount, transaction hash, and simulated success/failure outcome is identical
across runs as long as the seed string is the same.

---

## How it works

`src/lib/seeded-rng.ts` exports three functions used by every mock data module:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `random()` | Returns a float in `[0, 1)` |
| `randomInt(min, max)` | Returns an integer in `[min, max)` |
| `randomItem(array)` | Returns one element from the array |

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED` is set, all three use a Mulberry32 PRNG seeded
from a DJB2 hash of the string value. When unset or empty, they fall back to
`Math.random()` so normal dev behaviour is unchanged.

The seed is a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable — it is inlined into the browser bundle
at build time by Next.js and is also available as `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED`
on the server. It contains no secrets.

---

## Enabling the seed

### Local development

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED=demo-seed-2026
```

Then restart the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Visual baseline capture

The server must already be running with the seed set before calling the script:

```bash
# Terminal 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED=demo-seed-2026 yarn dev

# Terminal 2
yarn qa:visual-baseline
```

The captured `manifest.json` records the `demoSeed` field so baselines are
traceable. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED` was unset when the script ran, the
manifest contains `"demoSeed": null` and a warning is printed.

### Toggling off

Remove the variable or leave it empty to restore random behaviour:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED=
```

## Where randomness is consumed

All of these modules route through `seeded-rng` and become deterministic when
the seed is set:

| Module | What it randomises |
|--------|--------------------|
| `src/lib/mock-chart-data.ts` | Portfolio value noise, yield bars, allocation slices, benchmark comparison |
| `src/lib/mock-services.ts` | ~15% simulated failure rate, auth token/user IDs |
| `src/lib/mock-auth.ts` | Session token and user ID suffixes |
| `src/lib/mock-audit.ts` | Audit event IDs |
| `src/lib/transactions.ts` | Transaction reference suffix |
| `src/lib/service-layer/base-adapter.ts` | Request IDs, simulated latency range, failure rate |
| `src/lib/service-layer/portfolio-service.ts` | Portfolio value history, simulated 24-hour changes |
| `src/lib/service-layer/strategy-service.ts` | Strategy APY noise |
| `src/lib/service-layer/transaction-service.ts` | Initial mock tx hashes, 90% success simulation, completed tx hash |
| `src/lib/service-layer/auth-service.ts` | Auth token generation |
| `src/lib/logger.ts` | Log entry IDs |
| `src/lib/analytics.ts` | Analytics event IDs |
| `src/components/onboarding/steps/WalletConnectStep.tsx` | 90% connection success simulation |
| `src/components/onboarding/steps/FirstDepositStep.tsx` | 95% deposit success simulation |
| `src/components/help/SupportForm.tsx` | Support reference ID suffix |
| `src/components/avatar/FileUpload.tsx` | Upload progress increment steps |

## Sandbox toggle

The QA Sandbox at `/dashboard/sandbox` controls UI state scenarios
(success / empty / loading / partial-failure / timeout) independently of the
seed. The seed only affects *data values*, not *which scenario is shown*.

To combine both for a fully reproducible demo environment:

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED=demo-seed-2026` in `.env.local`
2. Restart `yarn dev`
3. Navigate to `/dashboard/sandbox` and select "All Success"
4. Screenshots will now show identical values across repeated captures

---

## Unit tests

`src/lib/seeded-rng.test.ts` verifies:

- Values stay in `[0, 1)` range
- Same seed → identical sequence across two separate calls to `reseed()`
- Different seeds → different sequences
- `reseed(null)` restores non-deterministic behaviour
- `randomInt()` always returns integers in the specified range
- `randomItem()` always returns an element from the input array

Run with:

```bash
yarn test
```

---

## QA steps for PR verification

1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED=demo-seed-2026` to `.env.local` and start `yarn dev`.
2. Open `/dashboard` — note the portfolio balance and chart values.
3. Hard-refresh the page (`Cmd+Shift+R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R`). Values must be identical.
4. Open `/dashboard/strategy` — APY chart values must be identical across reloads.
5. Open `/dashboard/transactions`, submit a deposit — note the reference ID suffix.
6. Hard-refresh and repeat step 5 — the suffix must match step 5's value.
7. Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SEED` from `.env.local`, restart the server, and reload
   the dashboard. Values should differ from those in step 2 (unseeded = random).
8. Run `yarn test` — all `seeded-rng` tests must pass.

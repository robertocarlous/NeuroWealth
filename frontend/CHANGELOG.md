## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` with initial dated section and release notes process (closes #168)
- `.lintstagedrc` for optional pre-commit lint-staged setup (closes #166)

### Process
Release notes are maintained manually in this file by the PR author.
Each PR that ships user-visible changes must add an entry under `[Unreleased]`.
On release, the maintainer renames `[Unreleased]` to the version + date and opens a GitHub Release linking back here.

No automation (Changesets, semantic-release) is required at this stage.
If the team later adopts Changesets, this file becomes the generated output target.

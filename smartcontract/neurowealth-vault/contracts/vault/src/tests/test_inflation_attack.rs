//! First-depositor / donation inflation-attack scenario tests.
//!
//! ## The attack (on a vulnerable, balance-based vault)
//! 1. Attacker is the first depositor for a negligible amount and receives a
//!    tiny number of shares.
//! 2. Attacker "donates" a large amount by transferring tokens directly to the
//!    vault. On a vault that prices shares off its live token balance, this
//!    inflates the price per share.
//! 3. A victim deposits; with the price inflated, their assets round DOWN to
//!    zero shares. The attacker then redeems the victim's funds.
//!
//! ## Why this vault is safe (audit conclusion)
//! Share pricing reads the **stored** `TotalAssets`, which is only mutated by
//! `deposit`, `withdraw`, and the agent's balance-verified `update_total_assets`.
//! A direct token transfer to the vault does not change `TotalAssets`, so the
//! donation step (2) is a no-op for pricing. Combined with the minimum-deposit
//! floor and the non-zero-share-mint guard, the attack is neutralized. These
//! tests assert that behavior.

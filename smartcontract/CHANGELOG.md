# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented in this file.
This changelog is tied to the vault contract `Version` storage value. Each released contract upgrade should add a new entry matching the stored version number.

> **Contributors:** Any PR that changes on-chain contract behavior, emitted events, error codes,
> or the `Version` storage value **must** update this file. Add your changes under `[Unreleased]`
> and note the target `Version` value if an upgrade is planned. See the PR checklist in
> `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## [Unreleased]
<!-- Add entries below. Format: `- Short description (Issue #N).` -->
<!-- If this PR bumps get_version(), note the new Version value here. -->
- **Timelocked contract upgrade (Issue #316):** the instant `upgrade()` is
  replaced by a two-step, timelocked flow with a cancel path so a compromised
  owner key can no longer swap WASM with no recovery window.
  - New `schedule_upgrade(owner, new_wasm_hash)` records a pending hash and a
    ≈24-hour (`UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS`) expiry ledger; `execute_upgrade(owner)`
    applies it only after the timelock; `cancel_upgrade(owner)` clears a pending
    upgrade. `get_pending_upgrade()` exposes the pending hash and expiry.
  - New storage keys `DataKey::PendingUpgradeHash` / `UpgradeTimelockExpiry`.
  - New events `UpgradeScheduledEvent` (`upg_sched`) and `UpgradeCancelledEvent`
    (`upg_cncl`); `UpgradedEvent` is now emitted by `execute_upgrade`. See EVENTS.md.
  - Error codes 48–50 are generalized from agent-specific to shared timelock
    names (`TimelockAlreadyPending`, `NoTimelockPending`, `TimelockNotExpired`)
    and reused by both the agent (#317) and upgrade timelocks, since the SDK caps
    `#[contracterror]` enums at 50 cases. Numeric codes are unchanged.
  - No `Version` bump (pre-mainnet).
- Add snapshot tests for the DEX event payloads `DexSupplyEvent`,
  `DexWithdrawEvent`, and `DexPoolConfiguredEvent`, mirroring the existing Blend
  event snapshot tests (Issue #340).
- Add ApprovalTtl test coverage for the DEX supply path: default TTL, configured
  TTL, and min/max bound rejection, mirroring the Blend coverage (Issue #341).
- `deploy-devnet.sh` now writes `OWNER_ADDRESS` to `devnet-contracts.env` so
  `verify-deployment.sh` can run without missing-variable errors (Issue #298).
- Document the `TotalDeposits` vs `TotalAssets` design decision in `lib.rs`,
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `test_total_assets_cap.rs`; `TotalDeposits` is
  intentionally not synced on yield — all cap guards use `TotalAssets`
  (Issue #299).
- Add GitHub issue templates as structured YAML forms (Issue #330).
- Migrate weak `!events.is_empty()` test assertions to strict payload checks (Issue #333).
- Dedicated `TvlCapUpdatedEvent` / `UserDepositCapUpdatedEvent` replace ambiguous
  `LimitsUpdatedEvent` for cap-only updates; indexer migration note added to EVENTS.md (Issue #328).
- CHANGELOG.md now tied to contract `Version` with PR template reminder (Issue #335).
- **DEX liquidity pool integration (Issue #228):** the vault can now deploy USDC
  to a Stellar DEX liquidity pool in addition to Blend, implementing the
  on-chain side of the Balanced/Growth strategies.
  - Added owner-configurable `DataKey::DexPool` with `set_dex_pool` / `get_dex_pool`.
  - Added `supply_to_dex` / `withdraw_from_dex` internal helpers mirroring Blend.
  - `rebalance` now accepts the `"dex"` protocol symbol with `min_out` slippage
    protection; `CurrentProtocol` and `ProtocolChangedEvent` reflect DEX deployments.
  - User `withdraw` / `withdraw_all` pull liquidity back from the DEX when needed.
  - New events: `DexSupplyEvent` (`dex_sup`), `DexWithdrawEvent` (`dex_wd`),
    `DexPoolConfiguredEvent` (`dex_cfg`).
  - New errors: `DexPoolNotConfigured` (#46), `OnlyOwnerCanSetDexPool` (#47).
  - New `dex-devnet` test feature flag. No `Version` bump (additive, pre-mainnet).
  - See `docs/DEX_INTEGRATION.md`.

## [1]
- Initial vault implementation with ERC-4626-inspired share accounting.
- `get_version()` returns the contract version from `DataKey::Version`.
- `UpgradedEvent` emits both `old_version` and `new_version` for on-chain auditability.

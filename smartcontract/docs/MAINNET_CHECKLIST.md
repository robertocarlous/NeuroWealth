## 1. Key Management Setup (Separate Owner & Agent Keys)

To uphold the principle of least privilege and prevent single points of failure, **the Owner and Agent keys must be completely separate and generated independently**.

### 🔍 Security Context
* **Owner (Cold/Multisig):** Holds sensitive administrative capabilities like contract pausing, unpausing, TVL/cap changes, and contract upgrades. This key represents a high-value target and should be kept securely offline (e.g., hardware wallet or multi-signature account setup).
* **AI Agent (Hot):** Used by the automated backend system to submit frequent rebalancing signals and assets updates (`rebalance` and `update_total_assets`). Since it lives in a hot environment (server memory), it faces a higher compromise risk. 
* **The Risk:** If the Owner and Agent keys are the same, a compromise of the AI agent backend would immediately compromise the ownership and control of the entire contract, enabling an attacker to upgrade the contract or block users from withdrawing.

### 📝 Actionable Checklist
- [ ] **Generate Independent Keypairs:** Ensure that the Owner address ($G_{owner}$) and Agent address ($G_{agent}$) are completely separate and do not share any key material.
- [ ] **Establish Key Storage Environments:**
  - Owner private key: Saved in a secure offline HSM, multi-sig hardware wallet, or Stellar Multisig account.
  - Agent private key: Stored in a secure environment variables vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, Supabase Vault) with restricted read access.
- [ ] **Pre-Launch Address Verification:**
  - Query testnet/mainnet deploy keys:
    ```bash
    owner_addr=$(stellar contract invoke --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID --network mainnet -- get_owner)
    agent_addr=$(stellar contract invoke --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID --network mainnet -- get_agent)
    ```
  - Verify that `$owner_addr` != `$agent_addr`.

> **Automated check** — `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` asserts owner address, agent address, and owner ≠ agent separation in one command:
> ```bash
> VAULT_CONTRACT_ID=C... NETWORK=mainnet \
>   OWNER_ADDRESS=G... AGENT_ADDRESS=G... AGENT_SECRET_KEY=S... \
>   USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=G... \
>   ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
> ```

## 2. Initialization Parameters & Deployment Verification

Initialization of the `NeuroWealthVault` uses a cryptographic commitment to protect against front-running. The deployer key must immediately call `initialize` after deployment.

### 🔍 Security Context
* The contract verifies that the `deployer` address combined with the deployed `salt` cryptographically reproduces the contract address and requires deployer's authentication (`deployer.require_auth()`).
* After successful initialization, the temporary deployer key has no administrative powers.

### 📝 Actionable Checklist
- [ ] **Deployer Key Separation:** Generate a clean, single-use `deployer` keypair. Fund it with enough native XLM to cover deployment fees.
- [ ] **Parameter Configuration Verification:** Double-check the mainnet initialization arguments before submitting the transaction:
  * `--deployer`: Address of the temporary deployer key.
  * `--owner`: Verified cold/multisig owner address.
  * `--agent`: Verified AI agent address.
  * `--usdc_token`: Official Stellar Mainnet USDC Token address (`GBBD67VQMKA676776SGXN6776...` - verify on Stellar Expert).
  * `--salt`: A securely generated 32-byte hash.
- [ ] **Execute and Discard Deployer Key:**
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID \
    --source deployer \
    --network mainnet \
    -- \
    initialize \
    --deployer $DEPLOYER_ADDRESS \
    --owner $OWNER_ADDRESS \
    --agent $AGENT_ADDRESS \
    --usdc_token $USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS \
    --salt $SALT
  ```
- [ ] **Post-Init Read Verification:**
  * Run `get_owner` to confirm it returns `$OWNER_ADDRESS`.
  * Run `get_agent` to confirm it returns `$AGENT_ADDRESS`.
  * Run `get_usdc_token` to confirm it returns `$USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS`.
- [ ] **Discard Deployer Key:** Erase/discard the temporary deployer key. It should never be reused.

## 3. Administrative Caps & Deposit Limits Configuration

To limit financial risk and systemic exposure during the initial stages of launch, safety caps must be configured.

### 🔍 Security Context
* **TVL Cap:** Prevents the vault from accepting more than a specific aggregate deposit, limiting the overall capital at risk.
* **User Deposit Cap:** Limits exposure per single user, preventing whales from dominating the pool and mitigating risks of heavy individual exposure.
* **Deposit Limits (Min/Max):** Enforces transaction thresholds (minimum of 1 USDC to protect against dust attacks and first-depositor inflation attacks).

### 📝 Actionable Checklist
- [ ] **Initial TVL Cap Setup:** Determine the conservative launch phase TVL cap (e.g., $100,000 USD represented as `100000000000` base units - 7 decimals).
- [ ] **Initial User Deposit Cap Setup:** Determine the initial limit per user (e.g., $5,000 USD represented as `5000000000` base units).
- [ ] **Enforce Caps:** Call `set_caps` via the Owner key:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID \
    --source owner \
    --network mainnet \
    -- \
    set_caps \
    --user_deposit_cap 5000000000 \
    --tvl_cap 100000000000
  ```
- [ ] **Set Transaction Limits:** Call `set_deposit_limits` (e.g., min 1 USDC, max 5,000 USDC):
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID \
    --source owner \
    --network mainnet \
    -- \
    set_deposit_limits \
    --min 1000000 \
    --max 5000000000
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Settings:** Query getters `get_tvl_cap`, `get_user_deposit_cap`, `get_min_deposit`, and `get_max_deposit` to verify correctness.

> **Automated check** — `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` fetches all four caps and compares them against your declared expected values:
> ```bash
> VAULT_CONTRACT_ID=C... NETWORK=mainnet \
>   OWNER_ADDRESS=G... AGENT_ADDRESS=G... AGENT_SECRET_KEY=S... \
>   USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=G... \
>   EXPECTED_TVL_CAP=100000000000 \
>   EXPECTED_USER_DEPOSIT_CAP=5000000000 \
>   EXPECTED_MIN_DEPOSIT=1000000 \
>   EXPECTED_MAX_DEPOSIT=5000000000 \
>   ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
> ```
> The script exits non-zero if any cap does not match or if an `EXPECTED_*` variable is missing.

## 4. Blend Pool Integration & Address Verification

The NeuroWealth AI agent deploys assets into Blend lending pools. Registering the correct, verified mainnet contract address for Blend is critical.

### 🔍 Security Context
* Deploying to an incorrect or malicious pool address can lead to instant loss of principal funds.
* While the contract's `set_blend_pool` method performs interface probing by calling `balance()` to confirm the contract conforms to the expected Blend pool structure, this does not guarantee the address belongs to the genuine Blend protocol.

### 📝 Actionable Checklist
- [ ] **Retrieve Official Blend Registries:** Match the Blend mainnet pool address against:
  * Official Blend Protocol documentation.
  * Verified GitHub repository resources or Blend UI configurations.
  * The verified on-chain deployment logs on a block explorer (Stellar Expert).
- [ ] **Perform Interface/State Verification:** Call the pool's read methods directly on the mainnet RPC to check pool parameters.
- [ ] **Register Verified Blend Pool:** Call `set_blend_pool` using the Owner key:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID \
    --source owner \
    --network mainnet \
    -- \
    set_blend_pool \
    --owner $OWNER_ADDRESS \
    --pool_address $VERIFIED_BLEND_POOL_ADDRESS
  ```
- [ ] **Read Verification:** Query `get_blend_pool` on the vault to confirm the registered address matches the verified Blend pool address.

> **Automated check** — set `BLEND_POOL_ADDRESS` and `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` will assert that `get_blend_pool()` returns that exact address (not null):
> ```bash
> VAULT_CONTRACT_ID=C... NETWORK=mainnet \
>   OWNER_ADDRESS=G... AGENT_ADDRESS=G... AGENT_SECRET_KEY=S... \
>   USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=G... \
>   BLEND_POOL_ADDRESS=C... \
>   ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
> ```

## 5. Emergency Procedures & Pause Drill Runbook

Before deploying to Mainnet, the team must run an on-chain Pause Drill on Testnet to guarantee emergency mechanisms function as intended and operators are trained in execution.

### 🔍 Security Context
* The `pause` function blocks all deposits, withdrawals, and rebalances during an active hack, protocol compromise, or market emergency.
* Operators must be familiar with the latency, transaction structure, and consequences of pausing/unpausing the contract.

### 📝 Execution Plan (Pause Drill Runbook)
1. **Trigger Emergency Pause:** Owner invokes `pause` on testnet.
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke --id $TESTNET_VAULT_CONTRACT_ID --source owner --network testnet -- pause --owner $OWNER_ADDRESS
   ```
2. **Verify State Updates:** Confirm `is_paused()` returns `true`.
3. **Verify Security Invariants (Deposits):** Attempt a test deposit.
   * *Expected Result:* The transaction MUST fail and revert with `VaultError::Paused` (Error Code `35`).
4. **Verify Security Invariants (Withdrawals):** Attempt a test withdrawal.
   * *Expected Result:* The transaction MUST fail and revert with `VaultError::Paused` (Error Code `35`).
5. **Verify Security Invariants (Rebalances):** Attempt an AI agent rebalance trigger.
   * *Expected Result:* The transaction MUST fail and revert with `VaultError::Paused` (Error Code `35`).
6. **Trigger Resume (Unpause):** Owner invokes `unpause`.
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke --id $TESTNET_VAULT_CONTRACT_ID --source owner --network testnet -- unpause --owner $OWNER_ADDRESS
   ```
7. **Verify Resumed Operation:** Verify that `is_paused()` returns `false`, and normal deposits, withdrawals, and rebalances execute successfully.
- [ ] **Testnet Drill Completed successfully:** Sign off on the drill.

## 6. Upgrade & Governance Multisig Plan

The Owner key holds upgrade privileges. To secure the contract against single-key compromise or loss, the owner account should be configured with multi-signature security.

### 🔍 Security Context
* Soroban allows upgrading contract code via `upgrade()`. An attacker possessing the owner key could upload a malicious WASM binary to hijack user funds.
* Stellar natively supports multi-signature operations directly at the account level through account signer thresholds and weights.

### 📝 Actionable Checklist
- [ ] **Configure Owner Multisig Account:** Configure the mainnet Owner address with multiple signers (e.g., 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 setup).
  * **Threshold Settings:**
    * Low threshold (e.g., 1): For triggering simple operations or `pause()` (allows fast emergency response with a single hot trigger key).
    * Medium threshold (e.g., 2 or 3): For configuring caps, setting Blend pools, and `unpause()`.
    * High threshold (e.g., 3): For calling `upgrade()` (requires multi-party consensus to push new code).
- [ ] **Document Signer Distribution:** Ensure keys are distributed securely across key parties using hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger).
- [ ] **Upgrade Verification Procedure:** Ensure any future WASM upgrades are:
  * Built inside a deterministic environment (e.g., Docker container with exact Rust toolchain versions).
  * Checked against WASM size limits using standard optimization tools (`wasm-opt -Oz`).
  * Signatures collected offline from all co-signers before broadcast.

## 7. Third-Party Security Audit & Formal Sign-off

No smart contract should be deployed on-chain without an independent security audit and formal sign-off.

### 📝 Actionable Checklist
- [ ] **Run Pre-Audit Scans & Tests:** Confirm all unit tests pass locally:
  * Run `cargo test` and verify 100% success rate on comprehensive tests.
- [ ] **Complete Third-Party Professional Audit:**
  * Secure a professional smart contract auditing firm (e.g., CertiK, Zellic, OpenZeppelin, Halborn).
  * Resolve and fix any identified vulnerabilities (High, Medium, Low, Informational).
  * Receive final audit sign-off documentation.
- [ ] **Verify Findings In Codebase:** Verify that critical fixes (such as `withdraw_all()` balance protection, and `update_total_assets` balance checks) are compile-ready and active.
- [ ] **Final Sign-Off:** Gather signatures from the lead developers, security auditors, and product leads before deploying the finalized bytecode.

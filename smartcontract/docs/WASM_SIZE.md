# WASM Size Management

## CI Limit

The CI pipeline fails if the optimised contract WASM exceeds **1.5 MB** (configurable via `WASM_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

Stellar's Soroban network enforces a `maxContractSizeBytes` network parameter that caps how large a contract WASM can be when uploaded via `stellar contract upload`. The CI gate sits well below that limit to catch unintentional bloat early and leave room for future feature additions.

## Why This Matters

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| WASM > network `maxContractSizeBytes` | Deployment transaction rejected by the Soroban network |
| WASM > CI limit | PR blocked until size is reduced |
| Gradual growth | Limits room for future feature additions |

## How to Reduce WASM Size

1. **Audit new dependencies** — `cargo bloat --release --crates` shows which crates contribute most to binary size.
2. **Use `no-default-features`** — disable crate features you don't need.
3. **Prefer `soroban-sdk` primitives** — avoid pulling in heavy `std` types where a simpler alternative exists.
4. **Avoid `format!` / `String` in hot paths** — string formatting pulls in significant code.
5. **Run `wasm-opt` locally** to see the post-optimisation size before pushing:
   ```bash
   RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=mvp" cargo build \
     --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   wasm-opt --strip-target-features --mvp-features \
     target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/neurowealth_vault.wasm \
     -o /tmp/vault_opt.wasm
   wc -c /tmp/vault_opt.wasm
   ```

## Adjusting the Limit

If a deliberate feature addition requires a larger binary, update `WASM_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES` in `ci.yml` in the same PR and document the reason in the PR description.
